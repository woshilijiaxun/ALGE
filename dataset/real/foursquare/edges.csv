436,937,"I would avoid the prime rib. It was cold, all fat, and tasteless. Perhaps the worst piece of meat I have ever had. I actually left it behind and my server didn't even ask why. Must happen a lot."
436,975,"This place is VERY interesting. They only take AMEX or cash - no visa\/MC. The food is all very good and the crowd is amazingly diverse. Would recommend it for anyone but tourists will like this.a lot"
436,1002,Avoid this place. Way overpriced contrary to what Yelp says. Service was rude and awful and the waiters tacked on a little extra for tip and didn't tell us. AVOID AVOID AVOID
436,1176,"People, do yourselves a service and go get some real BBQ - not here. Really. I think Jimmy is from Long Island."

436,2242,Good beer specials - all day every day.
436,2255,These guys don't respect their neighbors and the noise is rediculous. Expect to get hit with eggs if you are one of the loud smokers...
436,2255,This place seems to keep plugging along in spite of the fact that nobody ever seems to be in it. The drinks are pretty expensive considering you can go up to Broadway for cheaper. Overpriced.
436,2255,$8 for a bottle of beer. Nuff said.
436,2426,The best pizza in NYC - hands down. Seriously.
436,2452,"I like the brunch here - but not the 30 minute wait. Get here early for that. Otherwise, skip it altogether. The Astoria has far too many better places to eat for the money..."
436,2858,Tripp is a fan if the giant chocolate chip cookie. They warm them up btw so they are extra gooey.

436,3251,"Just get the chicken and the sauces. Double fried with the spicy, tangy dipping sauce is really all that needs to be said. It's really one of the tastiest things you will ever eat in your life. This p"

436,3501,2 pitchers of very sub-par margaritas: $65. Nuiff said. This place turns over every 3-4 years and gets renamed something else Mexican.
436,3564,"Cheeseburger, onion rings and a 7-up is my perfect lunch at this place. Soooo good. Service is excellent as well. Not cheap though."
436,3584,"One of the most expensive happy hours I have ever had. 6 people $450. We each had 3-4 drinks. Really? Not very \"
436,3934,Get the falafel platter w eggplant. Heaven.
436,4030,"Good quality but pricey for what you get. You'll need an extra slice on top of whatever you regularly order. If not, you will leave hungry. Been around forever though. Just rennovated this year."
436,4236,Tasty but WAY overpriced. $8 for a frozen yogurt? Really? REALLY?
436,4249,Staff here is really nice. Drinks are good too. Nice vibe and there are plenty of real Cubans in here. You can tell by their hats :-) Tip: stop pouring scotch in shot glasses. It's just not right.
436,4530,"This place used to rock.I used to be a regular. Owner's been skimping on the ingredients though. Last time I ordered, the pasta was inedible. Have not ordered from them since."
436,4530,"After a long hiatus, I tried this place again and was very impressed. Antonio has really righted the ship and it is now our favorite Italian spot in the neighborhood. Great food, service, & price."

436,4772,Happy Hour is good here. Half price drinks and apps. Oh baby!

436,4915,You can't go wrong here. There is no bad choices IMHO. Definitely definitely definitely get dessert. You'll be sorry if you don't.
436,4915,The Jap Chae and Bul Go Gui are maybe the best I have ever had. Please don't tell my mother-in-law :-)
436,4915,All of the desserts here are just ridiculous. Fried banana or the coconut cake are my preferred way to end the evening.
436,4915,The Neua Kra Prow is for you - if you like spicy beef with vegetables. I get it almost every time.
436,4915,Get. The. Bulgogi.
436,5158,This place has the food pre cooked and waiting on the counter in the kitchen. It will come out instantly. Not great.
436,5158,The food is good here if it's crowded. If it's dead your food will come out instantly (read between the lines here). Service is good. Get the fried yuka and any grilled meat. Flan is nice too.
436,5224,"If you're not a regular here, don't expect any special treatment. It's so-so at best to begin with so I recommend avoiding it."
436,5224,Have never had a great experience here. Service is not good I unless you are a regular...
436,5540,Perhaps the best pizza in the neighborhood. Their hot dishes are no joke though. Spagetti and meatballs are off the hook. Pinwheels are killer too.
436,5795,"Cuban Chinese food. Find a better place and I'll be there. Good food, good service, not cheap. Mixed drinks are surprisingly awesome."
436,5795,"Chicken. With. Cashew. Nuts. Ummmm, yes!"
436,5810,Nice beer. Nice food. Not expensive. Crowd is usually friendly. Bartenders are pretty cool.
436,5810,Beer good. Food bad. Service worse. Maybe the worst Bloody Mary I've ever had. Told us halfway through brunch that the credit card machine was down. Won't be back. Go to Sanford's for brunch instead.
436,6274,"You are paying for the ambiance here. Don't expect a break on the drinks because you paid $300\/night for the room."
436,6394,Wish I could tell you how the food is here. They said it was over an hour wait for a table when the place was half full. If that's how they manage the front I'd hate to know how they manage the back.
436,6394,"They don't like kids in this place. More than half the tables were empty and they told us that it was an hour wait once they saw our carriage. Shady. One girl told us not to eat here, said it was bad."
437,438,"Well, they have a 'C' right now. So they have that going for them."
437,2604,The tater tots. Get the tater tots. You're welcome.

458,2536,"Actually, the service is horrific. Super slow."
458,2834,"Service was excellent, the food was terrific. It's pricey and very uber trendy... the place looks great, though. Eat in the lounge to hack the line... just as nice, if not better than tables."

726,3290,"Get the house ice coffee - it's cold brewed and delicious. No need to add milk - maybe a little bit of simple syrup, that's it."
726,3636,Pretty authentic Korean style tofu. The best (and probably the only) place for kimchi biji in NYC. I like the small plate of fish you get always with banchan. They also make rice in stone bowl.
726,4449,Try yellowtail collar here. They don't always have it but when they do you won't regret it.
726,5531,Come hungry for lunch specials. You will get a lot of food. Chirashi bowl and sura tanmen is very satisfying here.
726,5782,Get Turkish tea - it goes well with pretty much everything. Really friendly staff here.
726,6166,Baguette was too hard for my taste.
728,729,$5 apps at happy hour = great deal
728,4867,Classic burger. No frills. Worth braving a few tourists and a less bro-heavy ambiance than 3rd ave. bartenders downstairs are fabulous.
728,4867,"I'm shocked at the number of bad tips here. This is false. Yes, it gets crowded and the service can get overwhelmed, but that's par for the course with any famous NYC jaunt. Come on a quiet night."
730,729,Have an Abita Amber after upgrading your cable box at Time Warner a few blocks away
730,800,Try the 14oz and have the carrot cake.

740,739,Do not miss the Spicy Crispy Shrimp or the Big Eye Tuna Tarts. My favorite is the Tuna Crispy Rice. Make sure to sit at the sushi bar at least once.
740,945,Avoid the Phaalbat all costs. It might kill you.
740,2407,Do not miss this New York (Brooklyn) gem! Perhaps the best pizza on the planet. Get the plain pie first..you'll have a second one for sure and can add the mushrooms then!
740,2517,"Don't miss this BBQ joint. Outstanding food, great atmosphere, and awesome Banana Pudding!"
740,3274,try the homemade pastas at this hidden NYC gem!
741,739,Big Eye Tuna Tarts will change your life
741,1064,Soup dumplings
741,2106,"don't wait 2 hours for this pizza, it's really not worth it"
741,3054,definitely get the chana masala
741,5209,"The dessert gelato wasn't any good. $8 for melted gelato, 4 strawberries and sugar isn't worth it. The rest of the food was great, sea scallops with crabmeat was delicious."
742,739,Best. Bloody May. Ever.
743,739,the lobster tempura is a must!
743,1198,You HAVE to try the eggs benedict with apples on french toast..make sure you ask for bacon so the sweetness evens out..it sounds weird but its seriously amazing!
743,4802,Try the pink starburst off the secret menu..just ask! So good!
744,739,Alright food actually but don't expect any attention from the staff. Not even standing up waving the menu seemed to help.
744,1350,"Whaley Burger w fried egg, red beet and pineapple. Ozzie style!"
744,1879,"That's actually one of the worse burgers I've had. Pity, they seem so nice. BLT was quite soggy too."
744,3274,Rustic. Not fancy but good. Quick and friendly
746,745,Let them just bring out the goodness! They know what they are doing.
746,1674,Start with the spinach salad. It's delicious.
746,2068,"My current favorite steakhouse in the city. I say get the Rib Eye over the sirloin or the filet. Amazing, complete with Flintstone-esque protruding bone. ; )"
746,2992,FYI: No bathroom is kind of a bummer. Other than that perfection.
746,3484,They just redesigned the place so now there's plenty of space. Best pizza in this hood.
746,4136,Ground beef hardshell tacos. Do it.
748,747,Oh and oil on table >>>>>
748,1722,The nicest baristas! They are always on point with their Iced Tea Lemonades!
748,3799,Nicer Baristas
749,747,Try the Ciabatta Con Pollo Sandwich!
750,751,"Tasting menu with wine pairing was perfect. Amazing desserts!!! Lychee sorbet, wheat germ ice cream, and chocolate soufflé drools."
750,1249,"Apple crumb foie gras, lobster, and sea scallops were amazing! Finish off with Brooklyn Bridge dessert."
750,5355,Happy hour! Shrimp corndog and lobster slider!
752,753,"if you are a college student in the area, it's a PERFECT place to go before getting dropped off by parents. Otherwise, make sure to go there during Brooklyn Restaurant Week for a massive feast for $25"
752,1725,"Good place for take-out, or an affordable hour or two to hang out with friends. I was a big fan of their burritos and quesadillas here but everything is pretty good. Outdoor dining's great in Spring."
752,1807,Not as good and more expensive than John's Coffee Shop but has a lot more of a New York atmosphere with signed images of news anchors and foreign currency on the wall. Owner is really talkative too
752,1877,"Thin crust, more of a traditional Italian style pie like you'd find at Lombardi's or Grimaldi's. Tried the Arugula Pie as per Food Network's Ted Allen's suggestion, it was good but sausage is the best"
752,2123,"Expect to wait maybe fifteen minutes, but worth it, the BLT is a must, along with their chicken paninis. Place is small and crowded, so don't expect to be able to eat in. Expensive but worth it."
752,3604,"One of my favorite cheap eats in New York City, decor has a weird mix between traditional Japanese art and baseball. Order a Grand Slam Curry and split it, really great food and unlike anything else."
752,4258,"a great place to pair with a trip to the Botanical Gardens or Brooklyn Museum. Line is large on a Saturday, if you can, go on a week day. Pancakes and grits are the highlight here but lots to choose."
752,4305,"Portions here are giant, the place often has beggars by the door but food's good. Don't bother with the restaurant portion, prices are way higher there with same take-out food. Make sure to call ahead"
752,4406,This was a favorite place of one of my Thai friends. Always order the Thai Iced Tea and the Banana Sundae is a lot of fun. Definitely better than Thai 101 and they do take-out too which is great.
752,4430,"Great selection of cream cheeses and variety of bagels, I liked the blueberry cream cheese and cinnamon raisin bagels the best. Try ordering a burger or egg sandwich here, have bagel halves for bread."
752,4728,a bit of a walk if you're a Pratt Student but worth it. Fish n' Chips and Shepard's Pies are easy recommendations and deep fried pizza is interesting. Food goes half price on special during Happy Hour
752,4793,"If you're getting food here, go for the Tacos or the Bowls. Their rice and beans are nothing special, so the best strategy is to load up on sour cream and meat."
752,5549,"For most intents and purposes, if you are looking for something special, go across the street to Junior's, otherwise this is still a fun place to go with friends. Order the 2,000 calorie cookie desert"
752,5613,"Likely to be one of the first places you go to at Pratt. It's really good until you go to their sister location, The 3 Luigi's which is located a few blocks away. Still great and fast, a bit oily."
754,753,what a lovely cheesecake! see ya next vacation :*
755,753,I can't get over the rat that was seen on top of the cheesecakes a couple years ago. Google it please. If that's what their secret crack ingredient is count me out! no matter how good they are.
756,753,Try the matzo ball soup: _perfect_ from the chicken soup to the matzoh ball

756,4667,Try the Tongue Sandwich - #yummy #inappropriate #goaheadandmakefunofmeidareyou (via @Foodspotting)
757,753,Pricey but a BK must. GIFT IDEA--ship a cheesecake (in that amazing striped box) to a friend.
757,1543,They reuse the soup noodles--really unsanitary!
757,2395,"I know everyone loves this place, and it is good, but why not have coffee refills? Ridiculous."
757,3629,"Very friendly service, generous portions and strangely absolutely NO refills on soft drinks. Come on...its the 21st century!"
757,4357,These people are consistently polite--rarity.
757,4518,"I think Starbucks policy with regard to ice water is, from a business perspective (not to mention a psychological one), pathetic."
757,5340,Some of the employees are amazing. Some.
758,759,"Go to Florio's to enjoy great sigars, inside. You'll probably feel like you're in a soprano's episode. You might run into John Perry Barlow."
760,761,"Not as good as Chinatown, but not bad for this neck of the woods. You can order off menu."
760,2375,crab meat salad and tri color roll
760,4765,#45 - grilled beef over tiny rice sticks and an order of large spring rolls for appetizer
760,5436,Western Burger all the way
760,5491,"The rumora are true, it's alot of food"
763,762,"With all the mobster photos lining the walls, there\u2019s no hiding the mafia connection behind this East Harlem institution - I'd buy some of their pasta sauces on the way out, you filthy animal!"
765,764,The bartender who wears all the different ties is GREAT!!!!
765,2379,"Worst service ever! Went here with a large group and they gave my vegetarian friend a pasta dish with chicken and claimed it was fish. Totally unprofessional, the manager was the worst!"
767,766,"Even if it is not on the menu, ask for the Gator Burger... We eat here every time we're in NYC. This place is the best you'll get outside NO! Who Dat?"
767,766,The Jambalaya is really good too and their Hurricanes are authentic.
767,3345,"Best hole in NYC. Light mood, easy crowd (if you can call it a crowd). Really love this place!"
767,3735,"WOW! The Foie Gras w\/ truffle is very nice. Great veal dish, very creative and tasty. Would go back."
769,768,Love the cuban food and fun atmosphere
769,3500,"Best strawberry Mojitos in the city! Have a dinner at the bar, it's more fun!"
769,4703,My new favorite diner!
769,5260,"Nothing to scream about, unless you are tourist or coming from Jersey Shore to drink for your life in the city..."
769,5357,"What, they went to hunt that bison to Alaska?"
770,768,The Churrasco is amazing. Finish it off with the Pastelillos de guava and queso blanco and you're set.
770,2554,The Salmon Teriyaki lunch box is the best deal in Astoria! It's so good!
770,2708,The eggs benedict are a must! So savory & delicious.
770,2745,"Service was poor. Waitress kept us waiting even though restaurant was pretty empty. Asparagus was disappointing, croquettes were good but order only brings two. Overall it was forgettable."
770,4342,"Everything we had was delicious! We had the grilled vegetable appetizer, tomato & her croquettes and the beefteki. Plus they gave us a complimentary yogurt dessert!"
770,4688,"Wild Mushroom Appetizer was super tasty. I also loved the Grilled Chicken Bordeaux with butternut squash raviolli, sauce was delicious."
770,5065,The 48hr organic chicken was really amazing!
770,5630,"Their .99 cent pizza is not worth .99 cents... I do not recommend it, too thin, barely any cheese and it upset my stomach. I recommend Maoz next door."
770,5717,"I recommend the whole wheat steak wrap with your choice of toppings, a pomegranate tea and cheddar chips, all were fresh and very delicious."
771,772,So many good tapas to choose from. Didn't even get to the paella. Bacon wrapped shrimp was underwhelming but the croquetas were bomb. Check in on foursquare for free sangria. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
771,1322,"This was bomb. Blueberry pancakes for the win. Get a side of bacon and try the hot apple cider. Or the brunch cocktails and milkshakes looked good. Be here early, wait is\u2026 (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)"
771,1602,Love this place. Time it right to get a seat and enjoy a burger (or two) with the works. Not too long a line on off-meal hours. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
771,1625,"It was pretty damn awesome. Just think it's way overpriced. It's not twice as good as places like Jean Georges or Le Bernardin. But top notch. Ask for a tour of the kitchen\u2026 (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)"
771,1666,Surprisingly fresh $1 oysters for happy hour every day from 7-10pm. Service isn't always great but the oyster special makes up for it in my book. (2 of 4 petals via Fondu)
771,1743,"Pulled pork was great. Big seating area in the back with big tv's and I think an upstairs. Outta the way for most but if you're in the hood, definitely worth a look. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)"
771,1900,"Brunch was great. I housed the (grass-fed) steak and eggs and the granola in yogurt was bomb. Live music on Sundays, rag\/bluegrass, real fun. Def going back. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)"
771,2313,"Pricey, but it's grass-fed beef! Get a lettuce wrap and you've got yourself a nice Paleo (read: no carb) meal. Tip: fork and knife it. Need to come back to try the shake. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)"
771,2325,Lots of changes since I last went years ago but still great burgers. And what could be better than alcoholic milkshakes?! Couple outdoor seats for fair weather days. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)

1323,2078,"Sweet tea (and yeah, chicken biscuit)."
1323,2078,"There's lots of great food here, but you should only order the chicken biscuit your first 20 visits. Until Chick Fil A gets its act together and opens a real store in NYC, this is as good as it gets."
